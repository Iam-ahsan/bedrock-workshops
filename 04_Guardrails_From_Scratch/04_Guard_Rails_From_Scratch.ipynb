    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Guardrails for LLMs act as control mechanisms to ensure that LLM generated responses remain within desired parameters, preventing and correcting unwanted content output. They are programmable to follow specified interaction paths, respond to certain user requests in particular ways, and maintain a designated language style, among other controls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have tried using System Messages to address some of the concerns mentioned earlier (e.g. \"You are a helpful and friendly bot...\"). While useful, Guardrails offer an even more powerful solution that goes beyond standard system prompts.\n",
    "Unlike basic system messages, Guardrails treat the LLM as a black box component, allowing for separate monitoring of inputs and outputs. This enables the LLM to focus solely on its core task, while the Guardrails framework handles conversation monitoring and safety.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Guardrails, you can implement much more advanced conversation policies, guidance, and safeguards. System messages are limited to simple statements, whereas Guardrails allow for robust input sanitization, output filtering, conversational flow control, and more.\n",
    "So in summary - system prompts are useful, but Guardrails take AI assistance to the next level in terms of capabilities and safety. Guardrails don't replace system messages, they expand upon them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you delve into experimenting with guardrails in this notebook, you'll discover how they contribute to the safety, reliability, and ethical handling of LLMs.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll do.\n",
    "In this workshop, we will build our own guardrails from scratch. We will\n",
    "* Create our own content moderation endpoint\n",
    "* Create a topic filtering layer\n",
    "* Use prompt protection techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing this workshop, AWS Bedrock Guardrails is in private preview. Once GA, most of this code can be replaced in favor of using Guardrails from a managed AWS Service (Bedrock)"
